# Sherlock Book Search
Hi there!

This is an app that incorporates the GoogleBooksAPI in enabling people to search for their favorite books.

You can view the heroku deploment of this app at:

###Notes
Her are some future Steps I wish to take for further development of this project:

1) Testing:
I seriously struggled with how best to even begin testing an interactive single-page application. Creating working testing I believe is the most crucial step forward in improving this app.

2) General Styling:
I have the foundation of the aesthetic I wished for this app. However, there's much room for improvement in the layout used for displaying query results to the user.

3) Responsive Design:
Currently all my styling is geared toward a desktop interaction with the app. I would like to write an alternative mobile css sheet.

3) Cool hover icon:
I would like to create a hovering "click me for more info" text box over the displayed book covers, to inform users clicking a cover picture will link them to an information page.
