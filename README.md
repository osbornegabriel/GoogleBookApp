Notes
=====
Some future steps I wish to take for further development of this project:

1) Testing:
I seriously struggled with how best to even begin testing an interactive single-page application. Creating working testing I believe is the most crucial step forward in improving this app, as this is a glaring issue.

2) Decoupling Code From Dom:
This was part of where I received feedback on my app.

2) General Styling:
I have the foundation of the aesthetic I wished for this app. However, there's much room for improvement in the layout used for displaying query results to the user.

3) Responsive Design:
Currently all my styling is geared toward a desktop interaction with the app. I would like to write an alternative mobile css sheet.

3) Cool hover icon:
I would like to create a hovering "click me for more info" text box over the displayed book covers, to inform users clicking a cover picture will link them to an information page.
